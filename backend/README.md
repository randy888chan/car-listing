# Car Listing Backend

A Node.js backend service for managing car listings and handling trade-in requests. This service is built with NestJS, using TypeScript for better type safety and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Features

- **Car Listings**: Provides endpoints to fetch detailed information about car listings, including make, model, and specifications.
- **Trade-In Applications**: Allows users to submit a trade-in application, including basic details of their car and an image upload feature.
- **User Authentication** (Optional): Supports basic authentication to restrict trade-in applications to logged-in users only.
- **Data Validation**: Validates inputs for trade-in applications to ensure data consistency.

## Technologies

- **NestJS**: Framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database to store car listing and trade-in data.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and improved code quality.
- **Express**: Lightweight HTTP server used with NestJS.
- **Jest**: Unit and end-to-end testing framework.
